# ticTacToe
Rust implementation of ticTacToe

## Installation
This is a simple rust program. First you will need the rustc compiler.

Google the install, but here are the highlights:

1. sudo apt-get install curl (Ubuntu)
2. curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
3. Make sure /home/pi/.cargo/bin is in you PATH (echo $PATH). If not make sure to source ~/.profile
4. rustc ticTacToe.rs
5. ./ticTacToe

## How to play
The game is coordinate based with 0,0 being the top left.

## Summary
I'm new to rust and just getting to know the language. I'm sure there
are plenty of areas of improvement. This was a fun little project.
